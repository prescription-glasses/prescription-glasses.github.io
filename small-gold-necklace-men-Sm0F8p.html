<h3>GlassesUSA Nightmare: Wrong PD & Customer Service Black Hole 😠</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible experience with GlassesUSA, hoping to warn others. We ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, and he simply couldn't see properly with them. We discovered the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect, a critical measurement their site never prompted us for, simply assuming a value that was wrong for my child. This online shopping nightmare showed me that I would never be able to reach a human and have a real phone conversation, causing immense frustration as email interactions were too slow, dragging the process on. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage their customer service because this critical issue needed fixing, and the initial process was so broken.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about an order for my son. He can't see properly with the glasses, and his doctor confirmed the pupil distance is wrong. Your site never even asked for it, you just assumed a value!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty your son is experiencing and the frustration this has caused. I understand how crucial an accurate PD is. Could you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's order #123456789. The problem is, you assume this vital measurement, and then it's impossible to reach a real person to fix it! I've been stuck in automated loops.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with our automated system, and I'm here to help you now. We do offer a re-do for incorrect PD values. We can arrange for a new pair with the corrected PD. You would need to return the current pair first.
Customer: So, he'll be without glasses while we wait for a replacement? That's not ideal. How long will that take, and why wasn't this caught earlier?
CS Rep: Once we receive the original pair, we can expedite the production of the new lenses with the correct PD. We aim for the quickest possible turnaround. We apologize for the oversight regarding the PD input during the initial order process.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare 😤. I ordered for my son, and he simply couldn't see properly with them! Turns out the pupil distance was completely wrong, and their site never even asked for it – they just assumed a value that was incorrect for him. Trying to get it fixed was infuriating; I was stuck in endless automated loops, utterly unable to reach a real person for help. Email responses were agonizingly slow, dragging the whole frustrating process on and on 😭. It made me incredibly wary of buying glasses online ever again.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was hesitant, but I really needed new glasses and kept hearing positive things about cinily.net 🤔. I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a smoother, more human-centric experience this time. And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I started browsing, everything felt different. As one customer put it, they offer "Excellent products and excellent customer service" – and I couldn't agree more! The process for ordering my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=153">prescription glasses</a> was incredibly straightforward.</p>
<p>Their website was intuitive, making it easy to input all my prescription details accurately, completely avoiding the issues I faced before. The quality of the frames and lenses is superb ✨, feeling much more premium than their affordable price suggests. What truly stood out was their customer service – responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. I actually felt like they cared! My order arrived quickly, and the glasses fit perfectly. It’s such a relief to finally have a pair of glasses that are not only comfortable but also allow me to see clearly without any hassle. Highly recommend cinily.net for a truly positive experience! 😃</p>
