<h3>Online Glasses Nightmare: False Promises, Worthless CS & Ruined Plans! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, one I sincerely hope others can avoid. Frustrating is the word to describe this company - dishonest would be another. They claim 6 days to produce the glasses, but I seriously doubt anyone has actually had them make good on this. Their customer service bot is worthless, and I doubt there are any human reps. I ordered for a trip, thinking no problem, it will take a few weeks. Well, that trip has come and gone, and there's still no date in sight for my glasses. I'm pretty disappointed that they mislead on how long it actually takes, probably shipping them from China. This experience compelled me to reach out to customer service and then leave this review.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order #12345. It's been weeks since I placed it, and there's still no update. Your website claims 6 days for production, which is clearly untrue.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the delay you've experienced with your order. Let me pull up your details and see what's happening.
Customer: This is ridiculous. I ordered these for a trip that's already passed. I feel completely misled by your production times.
CS Rep: I truly regret that your glasses didn't arrive in time for your trip. It looks like there was an unexpected delay in the lens production for your specific prescription. We are working to expedite it.
Customer: So, what does "expedite" mean? When will I actually get them? I just want an honest answer, not another false promise.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of false promises and frustrating delays.

My last online shopping experience for glasses was an absolute nightmare 😤. 'Frustrating' is an understatement; 'dishonest' is probably more accurate. They claimed 6 days for production, but weeks turned into months, and a trip I bought them for came and went with no glasses in sight. Their customer service was non-existent – just a worthless bot, no real human help. I felt completely misled about their delivery times, probably shipping from China. It was incredibly disappointing 😭.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed new ones and decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a better outcome.</p>
<p>And what a difference it was! My experience with cinily.net was exactly what I had hoped for. Everything was top-notch – the lenses were cut exactly to my prescription, there was a better selection than most walk-in stores, and the customer service was genuinely courteous. They even offer speedy delivery with a money-back guarantee, letting you save tons!</p>
<p>The product quality is superb, and the lenses are perfectly cut. Their customer service is truly outstanding, with real humans who actually help! I found the entire process so smooth and easy, a complete contrast to my previous ordeal. The value for money is incredible, and the delivery was surprisingly fast, not weeks of false promises. I finally got the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">best prescription glasses online</a> without any hassle! I couldn't be happier with my new VANLOOK glasses from cinily.net. Highly recommended! ✨😃</p>
