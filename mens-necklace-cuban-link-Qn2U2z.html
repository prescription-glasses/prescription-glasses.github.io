<h3>Online Order Nightmare: Charged First, Refund Never! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm here to share my incredibly frustrating online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. My attempt to order contacts for my son turned into a nightmare. They charged my credit card <em>before</em> verifying the prescription, which is completely backwards and misleading. When I cancelled, my card was still charged, and I haven't seen a refund. Reaching a human in customer service was nearly impossible; the bot was useless. After finally getting through on chat, the representative ended the conversation before I could finish asking my questions about my pending refund. The process was misleading and frustrating, making me feel completely disregarded.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling again about my contacts order cancellation. My credit card was charged weeks ago, but the refund still hasn't appeared, and the previous chat ended without my questions being answered.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and the difficult experience you've had. I understand your frustration with the un-refunded charge and the chat ending prematurely. Let me pull up your order details to investigate this immediately.
Customer: This whole process has been incredibly misleading. Charging me before verifying the prescription, then not processing the refund after I cancelled? I just need my money back.
CS Rep: I completely agree that the order of operations should have been clearer regarding prescription verification. I'm seeing a pending refund request in our system from your cancellation. I will escalate this to our finance department right away to expedite the process and ensure it's processed within 3-5 business days. You will receive an email confirmation once it’s completed.
Customer: So I'll definitely get an email, and the refund will actually come through this time? I need assurance this won't be another dead end.
CS Rep: Yes, you will definitely receive an email confirming the refund processing, and I will personally follow up to ensure it is completed within that timeframe. I appreciate your patience as we resolve this.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience for eyewear was an absolute nightmare, and I'm still fuming about it 😤. I tried to order contacts for my son, and they charged my credit card <em>before</em> verifying the prescription, which is completely backward and misleading. When I cancelled, my card was still charged, and I haven't seen a refund for weeks. Reaching a human in customer service was nearly impossible; the bot was utterly useless. After finally getting through on chat, the representative abruptly ended the conversation before I could even finish asking about my pending refund 😭. I felt completely disregarded.</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online eyewear store. But my old glasses were falling apart, and I desperately needed a reliable place to get new ones. After some careful searching, Cinily.net caught my eye, and I decided to give them a cautious try, hoping for a better experience 🤔.</p>
<p>To my relief, my experience with Cinily.net was a breath of fresh air! My order came quickly, and the quality was excellent. It reminded me of a positive review I had seen, saying: "Love my glasses; the order came fairly quickly. The price was good, great fit. Will use blingcharming again." And that perfectly sums up my experience with Cinily.net too! The process was incredibly smooth, from selecting my frame—the Titanium Alloy Optical Glasses Frame Ultralight Oval Men Prescription Eyeglasses are fantastic—to submitting my prescription. The customer service, unlike my previous encounter, was responsive and genuinely helpful, not some useless bot. Finding quality and <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=153">affordable prescription glasses</a> has never been easier or more pleasant. I'm genuinely impressed and completely satisfied! 😃✨</p>
