<h3>Next-Day Delivery Scam: How I Got Ripped Off for $19.95! 😡💸</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about a truly terrible online shopping experience, one I hope you can avoid. After ordering twice before without issues, I thought I knew this company. But this third time was a complete fraud. I paid $19.95 for “next day delivery” for my glasses, only to receive an email hours later saying my order would take “3 business days.” This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers, ripping them off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. My attempts to call, use live chat, or email for a refund were met with silence or bots. The frustration forced me to push for a human, hoping to get my money back.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for next day delivery, $19.95, and then got an email saying my order would take three business days. That's not next day! I've tried contacting you multiple times about this.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the discrepancy regarding your delivery time and the difficulty you've experienced reaching us.
Customer: So, what are you going to do about the next-day delivery fee? I paid for a service that clearly wasn't provided. I need that refunded.
CS Rep: I can definitely submit a request to our billing department for a review of your next-day delivery fee. They typically process these refund requests within 3-5 business days.
Customer: A request? This isn't a "request" for something optional; it's a refund for a service I <em>paid for</em> and didn't receive. I expect this to be processed promptly.
CS Rep: I hear you, and I understand the urgency. I will ensure this request is escalated and flagged for immediate attention by the billing team for your refund inquiry.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unfulfilled promises and frustrating customer service.

I still shudder thinking about my last online glasses purchase. I paid $19.95 for “next day delivery,” only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take “3 business days.” What a complete fraud! 😤 My attempts to get a refund for the undelivered service were met with silence, frustrating bots, and unresponsive customer service. It was truly a nightmare, leaving me feeling ripped off and utterly disappointed 😭.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online retailer. But my old glasses were really beyond repair, and I needed new ones. A friend recommended cinily.net, mentioning their reliable service and good prices. I thought, why not give it one more try? 🤔 I’m so glad I did!</p>
<p>From the moment I started browsing, the experience was a breath of fresh air. It was clear this wasn't another automated nightmare. In fact, a customer review I read perfectly captured my feelings: "blingcharming has a wonderful fast service that I plan on using again. Thank you.😎"</p>
<p>cinily.net truly delivered! The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and their customer support, when I had a small query about my prescription, was quick, human, and genuinely helpful ✨. Not only were the prices fantastic, but the quality of the frames and lenses far exceeded my expectations for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=78">affordable prescription glasses</a>. My new Thom Brand Retro Round Glasses arrived exactly when promised, and they look and feel amazing. I finally found a place that cares about its customers and provides excellent value. Highly recommend! 😃</p>
