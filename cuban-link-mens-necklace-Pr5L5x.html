    <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>

<h3>🤔 For a while now, I'd been contemplating getting a new pair of glasses 👓.</h3>
<p></br>
For a while now, I'd been contemplating getting a new pair of glasses. My old ones were showing their age, scratched and a little warped, making my daily tasks, from reading to driving, just a little more strained. The thought of spending hundreds of dollars at a local optical store, however, always made me hesitate. I'd heard whispers about online eyewear retailers offering significant savings, but I was skeptical. Could an online purchase truly deliver the right prescription and fit without an in-person consultation? This was my primary pain point, and I knew many others shared it. It was this nagging need for affordable, quality eyewear that first pushed me towards exploring online options in early 2024.</p>
<p>My search led me down a rabbit hole of online reviews, comparison sites, and virtual try-on tools. I meticulously compared prices, frame styles, and customer service feedback. Cinily Eyewear popped up frequently, praised for its selection and competitive pricing, but also highlighted with concerns. I specifically remember reading a comment from Michael Connolly that made me pause: "Web site was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours to purchase two pairs of glasses. I was not able to type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase. so I will have to be sent an email so i can type in the information that i already typed in on your silly web site. I am not sure I will ever attempt to order glasses from glasses USA ever again. The entire process was so very frustrating and certainly a waste of my time." My own ordering process for the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> wasn't quite as arduous, though I did find some sections less intuitive than I'd hoped, especially when it came to ensuring my precise pupillary distance (PD) was correctly inputted. However, a glimmer of hope came from Ste Wie’s review, praising "Angie" for her "phenomenal" help with billing issues – a testament to the fact that human help, when accessible, could make a difference. Despite some initial hesitation, the appealing design of the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> and the promise of a better price ultimately swayed me.</p>
<p>The anticipation during the wait for my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> was palpable. I’d read countless reviews about shipping delays and questionable quality control. When the package finally arrived in late 2024, the unboxing was a moment of truth. The packaging itself was utilitarian, nothing fancy, but secure. As I opened the case, the sleek black acetate of the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> immediately caught my eye. They felt surprisingly robust, with a pleasing weight and smooth finish that belied their online affordability. The hinges felt sturdy, and the overall craftsmanship seemed much better than the "cheap plastic from China" that Raha A had unfortunately experienced, which gave them headaches. My initial impression was one of pleasant surprise – they looked and felt far more premium than I had expected.</p>
<p>Now, for the real test: daily wear. From the moment I put them on, the world snapped into clear focus. The prescription was spot-on, and the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> were incredibly comfortable, lightweight yet secure on my face. Reading small print was no longer a strain, and distant objects were crisp. The anti-reflective coating worked wonders, cutting down glare significantly. I was genuinely impressed with the optical quality, which felt comparable to glasses I'd paid double for in the past. However, my largely positive experience wasn't universally shared. I remember stumbling upon a comprehensive review by Denise LeFrancois that perfectly articulated the common frustrations and surprising upsides some customers encounter: "Firstly, be aware that the company replies to every negative review with the same answer….\"there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade\"! Garbage answer. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs and would never do that again!\nLook, I tried in vain to leave a review on the website, where my glasses are listed, but that doesn't work.\nSo after about a 10 minute search I finally am able to leave a review! The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced.\n\nJust so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money.\n\nMoving on…..I didn't really expect too much quality in the actual glasses but I was proven wrong! I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!\n\nDon't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the \"chat\", even though you will be transferred to \"live agent\", or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth.\nI would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!\nThey are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USA…..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone. The true height of the bifocal is measured on a 1:1 and goes by the individual eyes.\n\nFinally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days. Sadly, I have another pair of everyday wear coming that may fit my face better. But then I will be stuck with the pair I am currently wearing because this current pair is now 3 days past the 14 day window. Should I try to ask for help with this from the company? Yes, I should. Will I? No way will I because they have no one to help you!! I actually just changed the 3 star to a 2 star because of the piss poor customer service. Laughable." Denise's detailed account, which received a direct response from Cinily Eyewear outlining their improved self-service options and return policy, truly highlights the variability in customer experience. While my personal journey wasn't plagued by the same level of frustration regarding customer service or shipping delays that John Mitchell and David Sutton faced, I can certainly empathize with the points raised about inconsistent support and the "hit or miss" nature that Glen Carpenter also described.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> from Cinily Eyewear has been overwhelmingly positive. For the price, the quality of the frames and lenses exceeded my expectations, delivering clear vision and comfortable wear since early 2025. I would recommend Cinily Eyewear for those who are looking for a budget-friendly option and are comfortable navigating an online purchase, potentially with minor website quirks. While some users, like Steve Greenbaum and Kevin Carroll, unfortunately dealt with issues like incorrect PD measurements or wrong prescriptions and struggled with customer service, my own order was accurate and arrived within a reasonable timeframe. It seems like the product quality itself is strong, but the customer support can be a bottleneck for those needing assistance. If you're confident in your prescription details and don't anticipate needing much direct help, Cinily Eyewear offers incredible value, and these <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/202brand-mb710-acetate-square-optical-eyeglasses-frames-reading-prescription-glasses-frame-women-men?variant=40851617316900&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MB710 Frames</a> are definitely a stylish and practical choice.
