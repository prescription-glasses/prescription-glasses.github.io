<h3>Charged First, Then Ghosted: My Contact Lens Order Nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ’¸</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. My frustration stems from a contacts refill order for my son. The ordering process seemed fine initially, but then they charged my credit card <em>before</em> verifying the prescription, which makes no sense. When I couldn't immediately provide it, I cancelled the order, only to find my card was still charged and the reimbursement was nowhere in sight. Trying to get this resolved has been a nightmare; reaching a real person felt impossible, and when I finally did via chat, the representative ended the conversation abruptly before I was finished. This entire process was misleading and frustrating, compelling me to leave this review and demand answers from customer service.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about order 12345 for my son's contacts. You charged my card, then cancelled the order because you needed prescription verification, and now my money is justâ€¦ gone. I even tried chat, and the agent just ended it on me! This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the frustration and the difficult experience you've had, especially with the previous chat interaction. I understand you're concerned about a charge for a cancelled order. Could you please confirm the order number for me?</p>
<p>Customer: It's 12345. I was charged, then told I needed to verify the prescription <em>after</em> payment. I cancelled it immediately, but the charge is still on my statement, and no refund has appeared.</p>
<p>CS Rep: Thank you for that. I see the order and the cancellation request. Our system typically processes prescription verification before fulfillment, but sometimes the charge goes through first. I'm very sorry for that confusing process. I can confirm your refund was initiated on [Date], but it can take 5-7 business days to reflect on your statement.</p>
<p>Customer: Five to seven business days? Why was I charged in the first place if you hadn't even verified the prescription? This entire situation is making me question ever ordering from you again. I just want my money back.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration with the process and the delay. We are working to improve our system to prevent this in the future. I'll personally follow up on your refund and send you an email confirmation with the transaction ID within the next hour.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unexpected charges and frustrating customer service.

Let me share my absolute frustration from a recent online purchase. I tried to order contact lenses for my son, and they charged my card <em>before</em> verifying the prescription! When I canceled, my money just vanished, with no refund in sight. Reaching customer service was impossible, and when I finally got someone on chat, they abruptly ended the conversation before I was done. It was a completely misleading and infuriating experience. ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that nightmare, I was really hesitant to trust any online eyewear store again. But I urgently needed new glasses, and a friend highly recommended cinily.net for their clear process and great value. I decided to take a chance, hoping for a smoother, more transparent experience. ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, cinily.net was a breath of fresh air! As one satisfied customer mentioned, "Ordering and delivery were efficient." âœ¨ My experience mirrored this perfectly. The website was so user-friendly, allowing me to easily upload my prescription without any glitches. Their selection of stylish and high-quality <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=153">prescription glasses online</a> was impressive, and the prices were fantastic. My new anti-blue light shortsighted eyeglasses arrived quickly, and the quality is excellent. What a relief to finally have a positive online shopping experience! I highly recommend cinily.net for their seamless service and quality products. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
