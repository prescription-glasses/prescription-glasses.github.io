<h3>An Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong PD, No Help, & Pure Frustration! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
My recent online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a dire warning to others. My 12-year-old son couldn't see with the glasses we ordered, and after a doctor's visit, we discovered the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect. The site never prompted us for this crucial number; they simply assume a value that was wrong for him. My frustration grew immensely when I realized you will never be able to reach a human for a real phone conversation if you call them, and email interactions are painfully slow, causing the process to drag on. I felt compelled to leave a review and chase customer service because my son needed proper glasses, and the process was nothing short of infuriating.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about an order for my son. The glasses you sent have the wrong pupil distance, and he can't see with them. It's incredibly frustrating that your site doesn't ask for the PD, and I've had such a hard time trying to get help.
CS Rep: I'm very sorry to hear about the issue with your son's glasses and the difficulty you've faced reaching us. I understand how critical the correct pupil distance is. Let me look up your order and see how we can fix this for you.
Customer: Thank you. We went to the doctor, and they confirmed the PD was off. I'm just worried about how long an exchange will take, especially since I read we have to send them back first and my son will be without glasses.
CS Rep: I completely understand your concern about the waiting period. After we receive the incorrect pair, we'll expedite the production of the new lenses with the correct PD. We aim to process these as quickly as possible to minimize the time your son is without his glasses. Can you please provide your order number?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. I just hope this time it's smooth, unlike the non-working exchange links and slow email responses I've experienced before.
CS Rep: I assure you, I'll personally ensure this exchange is handled efficiently. I'll send you an email with the return label and clear instructions right after this call, and I'll monitor its progress. We'll make sure your son gets the right glasses.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My recent online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. My 12-year-old son couldn't see with the glasses we ordered because the pupil distance (PD) was completely wrong, and the previous site never even prompted us for it! Trying to get any help was an infuriating battle 😭, with no human support and painfully slow email responses. It left me feeling completely disillusioned and frustrated.</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to buy glasses online again 🤔. However, my son still needed proper glasses, so I decided to look for a company that offered a truly seamless and reliable experience, with a focus on customer satisfaction. That's when I found cinily.net. I was particularly encouraged by reviews like, "Good price and prompt delivery. Glasses work well."</p>
<p>From the moment I started browsing cinily.net, the experience was a breath of fresh air. Their site clearly prompted me for all crucial measurements, including PD, ensuring accuracy from the get-go. The selection for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=88">affordable prescription glasses</a> was extensive, and the prices were fantastic. What truly impressed me was their customer service – responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and the delivery was prompt. When the new glasses arrived, they were absolutely perfect ✨ – my son can finally see clearly, and the quality is exceptional. I couldn't be happier! 😊</p>
