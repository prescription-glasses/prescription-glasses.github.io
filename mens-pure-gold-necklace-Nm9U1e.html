<h3>My Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong Prescription & Zero Customer Service! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. What should have been a simple purchase turned into a nightmare. They <strong>sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea.</strong> The worst part? Itâ€™s been <strong>impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved.</strong> I've tried <strong>multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails and still canâ€™t get in touch with anyone.</strong> This frustrating situation compelled me to leave this review and try one more time to engage with customer service, hoping to finally get some help.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely fed up. You sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, and wearing them is causing me dizziness and nausea. I've tried reaching out multiple times across chat, phone, and email, and I can't get a human to help me.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the incorrect prescription and the discomfort you're experiencing, as well as the difficulty you've had reaching us. That is certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Can I please get your order number so I can look into this immediately?</p>
<p>Customer: My order number is GUSA12345. This isn't just an inconvenience; these are <em>safety</em> glasses that are unusable and making me sick. I need this rectified, and I need to speak with someone who can actually process a correct replacement or a full refund.</p>
<p>CS Rep: Thank you for providing your order number. I see here that the prescription on file does not match what you've described. I understand the urgency, especially with safety glasses. I will initiate an immediate reorder with the correct prescription, and we will waive any return shipping fees for the incorrect pair. Would you prefer a full refund or the corrected glasses?</p>
<p>Customer: I need the corrected glasses, but I'm worried about the wait. How quickly can these be made and shipped, given the error was on your end? And will I get a direct contact for this specific issue, not just another chat bot?</p>
<p>CS Rep: I understand your concern about the timeline. I will escalate this reorder to our priority processing, aiming for the fastest possible production and shipping. I will also provide you with my direct email for any further updates regarding this specific replacement order. We will send you a pre-paid shipping label for the incorrect pair shortly.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of receiving wrong products and facing nonexistent customer support.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. They sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, making me dizzy and nauseous, and trying to get a human to help was impossible! Multiple chats, calls, and emails, yet no resolution. I was utterly fed up and vowed never to buy glasses online again ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>However, I desperately needed new glasses, and after seeing positive comments about cinily.net, I decided to give them one last chance, hoping for a vastly different experience ðŸ¤”. And oh, what a difference it was! I found a review saying: "I am leaving a five star review in accordance with the ease of ordering and the virtual help i received online from Nicole, when I had a question. So far so good. I have ordered before and was very pleased with my glasses and Iâ€™m sure I will be again." This really resonated with me.</p>
<p>My experience was just as fantastic âœ¨. The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and their website was intuitive. When I had a question about my order, their customer service (actual humans!) responded promptly and courteously, unlike my previous ordeal. The quality of my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=137">prescription glasses online</a> is exceptional, especially considering the amazing price point. I finally received the perfect pair without any hassle or sickness! I'm so relieved and incredibly happy with my purchase from cinily.net. Highly recommend! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
