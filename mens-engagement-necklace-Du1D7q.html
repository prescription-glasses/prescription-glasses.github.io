<h3>I remember looking at my old, scratched glasses ðŸ‘“ and feeling a wave of dullness ðŸ˜©.</h3>
<p></br>
I remember looking at my old, scratched glasses one morning in early 2024 and feeling a wave of dullness wash over me. They were functional, but utterly devoid of personality, and frankly, I was tired of peering through smudges that seemed to appear moments after cleaning. My current prescription was fairly stable, but the idea of paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars, at a local optician for a new pair felt like a financial burden I wasn't ready to bear. I needed something fresh, stylish, and without breaking the bank. That's when the idea of online eyewear started to really appeal to me. I'd seen ads for various sites, promising chic designs and affordable prices, and I craved that liberating feeling of finding the perfect frame to express my style without the hefty price tag. Specifically, I was drawn to the timeless elegance of cat-eye frames â€“ something retro, yet modern.</p>
<p>My quest for new spectacles led me down the rabbit hole of online eyewear retailers. After comparing numerous sites, scrolling through countless frame styles, and reading more reviews than I care to admit, I finally landed on Cinily Eyewear. Their selection of cat-eye glasses truly stood out. The sleek, sophisticated design of the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-women-cat-eye-glasses-frame-ladies-eyeglasses-retro-half-frame-myopia-prescription-optical-eyewear-s2142?variant=39962820640804&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Merry's Retro Cat Eye Glasses</a> immediately caught my eye. The virtual try-on feature was surprisingly accurate, giving me a good sense of how they'd look on my face. Placing the order was straightforward enough, entering my prescription details and selecting lens coatings. I was tempted by the express shipping option, eager to get my hands on them quickly. However, a nagging thought from reviews lingered in my mind. One customer, Denise LeFrancois, had a particularly strong take on the shipping and customer service:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Firstly, be aware that the company replies to every negative review with the same answerâ€¦.\"there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade\"! Garbage answer. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs and would never do that again!\nLook, I tried in vain to leave a review on the website, where my glasses are listed, but that doesn't work.\nSo after about a 10 minute search I finally am able to leave a review! The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced.\nJust so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money.\nMoving onâ€¦..I didn't really expect too much quality in the actual glasses but I was proven wrong! I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!\nDon't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the \"chat\", even though you will be transferred to \"live agent\", or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth.\nI would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!\nThey are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USAâ€¦..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone. The true height of the bifocal is measured on a 1:1 and goes by the individual eyes.\nFinally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days. Sadly, I have another pair of everyday wear coming that may fit my face better. But then I will be stuck with the pair I am currently wearing because this current pair is now 3 days past the 14 day window. Should I try to ask for help with this from the company? Yes, I should. Will I? No way will I because they have no one to help you!! I actually just changed the 3 star to a 2 star because of the piss poor customer service. Laughable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her warning about express shipping made me reconsider. I opted for standard shipping, deciding a few extra days of waiting was better than feeling "ripped off." The wait felt interminable, stretching into several weeks. Every day, I'd check my email, hoping for a shipping update. The anticipation was real â€“ a mix of excitement for new glasses and a touch of anxiety, wondering if they'd truly be worth the wait, especially after reading such frank feedback about the companyâ€™s service.</p>
<p>When my package finally arrived in late 2024, I tore into it with the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. The packaging was simple but secure, protecting the frames well. As I pulled out the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-women-cat-eye-glasses-frame-ladies-eyeglasses-retro-half-frame-myopia-prescription-optical-eyewear-s2142?variant=39962820640804&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Merry's Retro Cat Eye Glasses</a>, I was immediately impressed. The frames had a solid, substantial feel to them, not flimsy or cheap as some online options can be. The retro half-frame design was even more striking in person, with a subtle sheen that caught the light beautifully. The lenses, a 1.67 Photo Gray, transitioned smoothly, hinting at the quality I was hoping for. The virtual try-on had been accurate, as they fit my face perfectly, sitting comfortably on my nose bridge. My initial impression was one of genuine surprise and delight â€“ a stark contrast to some of the frustrating narratives I'd encountered regarding the buying process.</p>
<p>Putting on the glasses for the first time was like seeing the world in HD again. The prescription was spot-on, and the clarity was exceptional. Denise LeFrancois, despite her frustrations, had also noted, "I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot!" I wholeheartedly agree. The optical quality truly did exceed my expectations; my vision felt crisp and comfortable, whether I was working on my laptop, driving, or just reading a book. I had opted for the water and fingerprint protection coating, and it's been a game-changer â€“ the lenses stay cleaner for much longer, which is a small but significant daily convenience. While I ordered single vision lenses, I noted Denise's point about bifocal height, reminding me how crucial precise measurements are for specialized lenses, and itâ€™s definitely something to consider if you're ordering those. The fact that the physical product itself was so good helped me overlook the extended shipping time.</p>
<p>My journey with Cinily Eyewear has been a bit of a rollercoaster of emotions. On one hand, the actual <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-women-cat-eye-glasses-frame-ladies-eyeglasses-retro-half-frame-myopia-prescription-optical-eyewear-s2142?variant=39962820640804&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Merry's Retro Cat Eye Glasses</a> are fantastic â€“ stylish, comfortable, and with excellent lens quality that genuinely surprised me. They've integrated seamlessly into my daily life, making me feel more confident and my vision clearer. However, the pre-purchase anxieties and the slow standard shipping (and the warnings about express shipping) tempered my overall enthusiasm. As Denise LeFrancois eloquently put it, "I would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!" This sentiment resonates. If youâ€™re like me, prioritizing a high-quality, affordable product and willing to be patient with delivery and potentially minimal customer interaction, then Cinily Eyewear is definitely worth considering. But if speedy delivery and readily available customer support are your top priorities, you might need to adjust your expectations or look elsewhere.
