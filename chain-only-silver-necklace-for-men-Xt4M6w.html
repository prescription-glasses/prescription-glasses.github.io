<h3>My New Glasses: A Cinily Eyewear Journey üëì‚ú®</h3>
<p></br>
I recently found myself squinting more than usual, a clear sign that my old glasses were no longer cutting it. The thought of visiting a traditional optical shop filled me with dread ‚Äì the pushy sales, the exorbitant prices, and the limited selection. I wanted something modern, durable, and, frankly, cool. My pain point was clear: I needed a new pair of prescription glasses, specifically square frames, that wouldn't break the bank but would still offer great quality. I‚Äôd seen ads for online eyewear retailers popping up everywhere, and the idea of trying on frames virtually and ordering from the comfort of my couch was incredibly appealing. I also remembered a friend mentioning how convenient it was. This resonated with me deeply; it felt like the perfect solution to my perennial eyewear dilemma, a sentiment echoed by many online reviews I stumbled upon, all seeking a more accessible and affordable way to update their vision.</p>
<p>My search quickly led me to Cinily Eyewear. Their website offered a wide variety of styles, and I spent a good hour using their virtual try-on feature, which was surprisingly accurate. After much deliberation, I settled on the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-men-square-glasses-male-myopia-prescription-eyeglasses-tr90-frame-titanium-alloy-legs-s2033?variant=39594476896292&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MERRYS DESIGN Square Myopia Glasses</a> with the matte black TR90 frame and titanium alloy legs. The price seemed incredibly reasonable, especially with the various coatings I opted for. However, my excitement was quickly tempered by concerns raised by other customers regarding the purchasing process and customer service. One reviewer, Mary K, complained, "Dishonest, doesn't honor promos. Makes it impossible to collect offer when the site is full of glitches. No customer Service 24 hours, no agent. Unprofessional." Another, Denise LeFrancois, specifically warned about shipping: "Just so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money." Given these warnings, I decided against expedited shipping, which felt like a gamble anyway. The wait felt interminable, but I reminded myself I‚Äôd saved a few bucks.</p>
<p>When the package finally arrived in early 2025, after what felt like an eternity, I approached the unboxing with cautious optimism. The packaging was simple and functional, nothing overtly luxurious, but it protected the glasses well. As I pulled out the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-men-square-glasses-male-myopia-prescription-eyeglasses-tr90-frame-titanium-alloy-legs-s2033?variant=39594476896292&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MERRYS DESIGN Square Myopia Glasses</a>, I was immediately impressed by the matte black finish and the lightweight yet sturdy feel of the TR90 frame. The titanium alloy legs gave them a premium touch, exceeding my initial expectations for the price point. The aesthetics were spot on ‚Äì they looked exactly as they did in the virtual try-on, perhaps even better. Unlike Angela Marie, who noted, "They aren‚Äôt scratch proof like they say but it‚Äôll work for the price I paid," I found the initial quality of the frame and lenses to be quite solid, especially considering the added coatings.</p>
<p>Now, for the actual wearing experience, which truly cemented my feelings about Cinily Eyewear. The quality of the lenses and frames on my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-men-square-glasses-male-myopia-prescription-eyeglasses-tr90-frame-titanium-alloy-legs-s2033?variant=39594476896292&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MERRYS DESIGN Square Myopia Glasses</a> was surprisingly excellent. Denise LeFrancois, whose comprehensive review I found quite insightful, perfectly articulated my own positive experience: "I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!" I absolutely agree; the clarity is fantastic, and the water and fingerprint protection has been a game-changer for someone like me who constantly handles their glasses. My vision feels crisp and comfortable all day long, a stark contrast to the strain I felt with my old pair. Nicole Morfa also shared a similar sentiment, praising her experience with Cinily Eyewear and stating she‚Äôd ‚Äúdefinitely recommend coming, I will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!‚Äù</p>
<p>However, the journey wasn't without its bumps, primarily due to the customer service aspect. I encountered the same frustrations as many others. Denise LeFrancois‚Äôs detailed account perfectly mirrors my own less-than-stellar interactions: "Firstly, be aware that the company replies to every negative review with the same answer‚Ä¶.\"there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade\"! Garbage answer. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs and would never do that again! Look, I tried in vain to leave a review on the website, where my glasses are listed, but that doesn't work. So after about a 10 minute search I finally am able to leave a review! The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced. Don't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the \"chat\", even though you will be transferred to \"live agent\", or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth. I would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! They are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USA‚Ä¶..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone. The true height of the bifocal is measured on a 1:1 and goes by the individual eyes. Finally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days. Sadly, I have another pair of everyday wear coming that may fit my face better. But then I will be stuck with the pair I am currently wearing because this current pair is now 3 days past the 14 day window. Should I try to ask for help with this from the company? Yes, I should. Will I? No way will I because they have no one to help you!! I actually just changed the 3 star to a 2 star because of the piss poor customer service. Laughable." Kevin Carroll also lamented, "It‚Äôs been Impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. Multiple chat sessions, phone calls and emails and still can‚Äôt in touch with anyone." My attempt to clarify a minor prescription detail via email echoed their frustration; responses were slow and generic. It's a real shame because the product itself is genuinely good, as Denise points out. I did notice the PD (pupil distance) issue mentioned by Steve Greenbaum, where it's assumed if not provided. Luckily, my standard PD worked out, but for more complex prescriptions like bifocals or specific PD needs, it's crucial to be proactive with your eye doctor's measurements.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my experience with Cinily Eyewear for my <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/merrys-design-men-square-glasses-male-myopia-prescription-eyeglasses-tr90-frame-titanium-alloy-legs-s2033?variant=39594476896292&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">MERRYS DESIGN Square Myopia Glasses</a> was a mixed bag, yet ultimately positive because of the product itself. The quality of the frames and lenses far exceeded my expectations, making them an incredible value. As Linda Miles concisely put it, "Love my glasses the order came fairly quickly. The price was good great fit. Will use EyeBuyDirect again." (Though in my case, it would be Cinily Eyewear.) If you can navigate the customer service black hole and are confident in your prescription details, especially PD or bifocal height, I would absolutely recommend them. They are perfect for budget-conscious individuals seeking stylish, high-quality eyewear. Just be prepared for potential communication frustrations and manage your expectations regarding expedited shipping. Despite the glaring customer service issues that nearly pushed my rating down to 2 stars like Denise, the sheer quality and affordability of the glasses themselves keep my recommendation firmly in the positive, with a strong caveat to be self-reliant with your order.
