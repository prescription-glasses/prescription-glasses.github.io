<h3>The Return & Reorder Trap: My Nightmare with Dishonest Promos 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale. This company is simply dishonest and doesn't honor promos. Their site is full of glitches, making it impossible to collect offers, and when things go wrong, there's no 24-hour customer service or an available agent. It's utterly unprofessional. I felt compelled to leave a review and speak to customer service after their response to my issue: asking me to return my correct style and prescription items just to reorder them to get the BOGO deal they messed up and admitted was their fault. A simple credit back to my card would have been too easy for them, apparently.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm really upset. I placed an order, and the promotion wasn't applied correctly due to a glitch on your website. Now I'm being told I have to return my glasses and reorder them?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the trouble you've experienced with the promotion and the website glitch. We do offer a return and reorder process to ensure the correct promotion is applied.
Customer: But these are the correct style and prescription! Why can't you just credit the difference back to my card? It feels like you're making this harder than it needs to be for a mistake you admitted was yours.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the process. While our standard procedure for applying missed promotions after an order is placed involves a return and reorder, I will check if there are any other options for your specific situation. Please allow me a moment.
Customer: This is exactly why I'm so frustrated; it's a ridiculous solution. I just want this resolved simply and fairly.
CS Rep: Thank you for waiting. I've discussed this with my supervisor. Unfortunately, for this particular promotion, our system only allows us to process it through a return and reorder to guarantee the discount is correctly applied to the new order. I genuinely apologize for the inconvenience this causes.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest promotions and frustrating customer service policies.

I was utterly fed up after my last online shopping experience. It was a complete disaster 😤. The company was dishonest about promotions, their website was full of glitches making it impossible to get offers, and customer service was nonexistent when things went wrong. They even had the audacity to tell me to return my perfectly fine glasses and reorder them just to get a promised deal, instead of simply crediting my card! It was unprofessional and so frustrating 😭.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was hesitant to try another online eyewear store after that ordeal. But I really needed new glasses, and after some research, I decided to give cinily.net a shot 🤔. I hoped for a better experience, something simple and straightforward, unlike my previous nightmare.</p>
<p>And what a pleasant surprise it was! My experience with cinily.net was genuinely positive. As one happy customer put it, "Good experience, didn't take too long to receive granted they are prescription sunglasses. They are very helpful and a good price." I wholeheartedly agree!</p>
<p>The quality of their products is fantastic, and the entire ordering process was incredibly smooth from start to finish. Their customer service was responsive and helpful, not at all like the previous chaos. Finding <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">cheap prescription glasses</a> that are also high quality can be a challenge, but cinily.net exceeded my expectations. I'm so thrilled with my new glasses and the amazing value I got ✨. It was a truly refreshing and delightful shopping experience! I finally found a company that cares about its customers and delivers what it promises. Highly recommend! 😃</p>
