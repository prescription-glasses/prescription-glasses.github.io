<h3>My Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong PD & Unresponsive Support! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. We ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, excited after he used their virtual try-on. But when they arrived, he had trouble seeing. We discovered the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect; the site just assumes a value if you don't know to provide it, which means it will be wrong for many buyers. This led to incredible frustration, because you can never reach a human at GlassesUSA, and email interactions are painfully slow. I felt compelled to leave a review and then engage with customer service to try and rectify this crucial error.</p>
<p>Customer: Hi, I'm calling about an order for my son's glasses. He's having trouble seeing, and we found out the pupil distance (PD) on the glasses is incorrect.
CS Rep: I understand your concern, and I apologize for the difficulty your son is experiencing. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. The issue is, your site doesn't prompt for PD, and it just assumes a value, which obviously wasn't right for us. This has caused a lot of hassle.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I see the details here. We understand that an incorrect PD can cause vision issues. We are happy to remake the lenses with the correct PD for you.
Customer: So, how does that work? Do I have to send these back first? We can't be without glasses while waiting. And frankly, trying to get a hold of someone has been incredibly difficult.
CS Rep: Yes, we do require the original glasses to be returned before we can process the replacement order. I truly apologize for the difficulty you've experienced in reaching us. Once we receive your return, we'll expedite the new order.
Customer: Expedite implies it's still going to take time. This whole process has been very frustrating.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of incorrect prescriptions and frustrating customer service.

I was absolutely heartbroken and incredibly frustrated after my last online glasses purchase. We ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, but he couldn't see properly. It turned out their site had just assumed his pupil distance (PD) ðŸ˜¤, leading to a completely wrong prescription. Reaching a human for help was impossible, and email responses were agonizingly slow. The whole process was a nightmare, and having to send back the only pair he had before a replacement could even start was just unacceptable ðŸ˜­. I swore Iâ€™d never buy glasses online again.</p>
<p>However, after that terrible experience, I still needed new glasses, and traditional stores were just too expensive. I kept searching, hoping to find a company that actually cared about its customers and product accuracy. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net ðŸ¤”. I was cautiously optimistic, hoping for a stark contrast to my previous ordeal.</p>
<p>And what a difference it was! As one happy customer put it, "Loved the overall experience! From picking my own frames from the selection, 'trying' them out virtually and reasonable cost!" My experience mirrored this completely. The process was incredibly smooth from start to finish. I easily found beautiful <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">affordable prescription glasses</a>, the "France Brand Acetate Prescription Glasses Frames Women Small Size c2" to be exact, and the virtual try-on was genuinely helpful. The quality of the frames feels premium, not cheap at all âœ¨, and the lenses are perfectly clear with the correct prescription. Plus, if I had questions, their customer service was actually responsive and helpful, not like the automated void I faced before. This has truly restored my faith in online glasses shopping! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
