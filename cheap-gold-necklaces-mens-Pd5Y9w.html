<h3>The Warranty Trap: How My $189 Glasses Became a $130 Rip-Off ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
Please, learn from my terrible online shopping experience. This place is the worst. I ordered glasses for my child with an added warranty, expecting quality and service, but they haven't gotten a single order right since. When I needed a replacement due to the frame breaking, each time I've needed a lens replacement, they tell me my choice of frame is out of stock. I end up receiving a store credit plus a small percentage, which doesn't make sense when I end up with a cheaper and lighter pair than the previous one. I'm so tired of dealing with this crap, especially with a $30 deductible for each replacement. The value of my order started at like $189 and is now somewhere around $130â€”it feels like a total joke and robbery you don't even realize due to the way they credit back and their fake discount codes. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because this continuous cycle of disappointment and losing money needs to stop.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely fed up. This is the fourth time I've tried to get a replacement for my child's glasses, and it's always the same story. My original frame is "out of stock," and then I'm forced to pick something cheaper, getting less value for my warranty.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the frustration and inconvenience you've experienced with the replacement process. I understand this has been an ongoing issue, and that's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into the history?
Customer: It's #123456789. Every time, I'm told my frame is out of stock, and then I get a store credit that doesn't even cover a comparable replacement, especially with the $30 deductible. My order value has just kept decreasing from $189 to $130, and it feels like a rip-off.
CS Rep: Thank you for that. I see the history here. This is definitely not ideal. Let me see what options we have. While we can't always guarantee exact frame availability, I can check our current inventory for a similar style that would be a direct exchange, and as a gesture of goodwill for the repeated issues, I can waive the $30 deductible for this replacement.
Customer: Waiving the deductible helps, but I need a comparable quality frame, not something cheaper again. I'm really losing faith here.
CS Rep: I completely understand your concern. I will personally review our available inventory for the most comparable frame, ensuring it's not a downgrade in quality or value. If there are no suitable direct replacements, I will explore an option to provide a higher credit than standard to ensure you get a satisfactory pair of glasses for your child.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I can't even begin to describe the disappointment and frustration from my last online glasses purchase. ðŸ˜¤ It was a nightmare! I bought glasses for my child with a warranty, expecting quality service, but they never got an order right. Every time a replacement was needed â€“ whether for a broken frame or new lenses â€“ my chosen frame was "out of stock." I'd get a measly store credit, forcing me into cheaper, lighter pairs. Plus, a ridiculous $30 deductible for each replacement! My order value plummeted from $189 to $130 â€“ it felt like a total rip-off and a scam I only realized through their convoluted credit system and fake discounts. ðŸ˜­ I was so fed up.</p>
<p>After such a terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try another online glasses store. I felt compelled to find a place that actually values its customers and delivers what it promises, unlike my previous ordeal. ðŸ¤” That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net, hoping for a different, more reliable experience.</p>
<p>And what a pleasant surprise! As one reviewer put it, "I am leaving a five star review in accordance with the ease of ordering and the virtual help i received online from Nicole, when I had a question. So far so good. I have ordered before and was very pleased with my glasses and Iâ€™m sure I will be again." âœ¨ I couldn't agree more! From the moment I started browsing, cinily.net felt incredibly user-friendly. The selection of <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=142">cat eye prescription glasses</a> was fantastic, offering stylish options that genuinely caught my eye. The quality of the frames I received for my child was superb â€“ sturdy and comfortable, exactly what we needed. Their customer service was a breath of fresh air; quick, helpful, and genuinely caring, a stark contrast to the automated nightmares I'd dealt with before. The pricing was transparent and fair, and the whole process was smooth from start to finish. No hidden fees, no bait-and-switch with store credits, just honest value and excellent products. Highly recommend! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
