<h3>GlassesUSA Warning: My $246 Refund Vanished! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share my terrible online shopping experience with GlassesUSA as a cautionary tale for anyone considering them. My order, #105081183, placed on February 24th, never arrived. GlassesUSA has still not sent my refund for glasses I never received; they have $246.00 of my hard-earned money. The tracking number still shows it stuck in Atlanta, Georgia. I couldn't get a response for a refund; all they kept telling me was it was in transit from a BOT. I want my money back! I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because this lack of response and resolution is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Customer: I need to know what's happening with my order #105081183. Itâ€™s stuck in Atlanta, I never got my glasses, and I haven't received my $246 refund. All I get are automated messages!</p>
<p>CS Rep: I truly apologize for the distress and frustration this situation has caused you. I understand how upsetting it is to not receive your order and have difficulty getting a clear answer. Let me review your order details right away.</p>
<p>Customer: This is ridiculous. I've been told it's "in transit" repeatedly by a bot. I just want my money back. I used Zenni before and never had this problem.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I hear your frustration loud and clear. Based on the tracking information and the extended delay, I can confirm that we need to process a full refund for you. I'm initiating that now. Please allow 7-10 business days for the refund to reflect on your original payment method.</p>
<p>Customer: Finally, a real person! But 7-10 business days still feels like a long time after waiting this long.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I completely understand your impatience, and I assure you we are expediting this process. You will receive an email confirmation as soon as the refund is officially initiated.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had a truly terrible online shopping experience. I placed an order (#105081183) for glasses on February 24th with another online retailer, but they never arrived. My tracking number stubbornly showed the package stuck in Atlanta, Georgia, for weeks on end. To make matters worse, all attempts to get a refund or a clear answer resulted in frustrating automated messages from a bot, constantly insisting my order was "in transit." I'm still waiting for my $246 refund for glasses I never received, feeling completely ripped off ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After such a disheartening ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online glasses store ðŸ¤”. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I was determined to find a reliable alternative. A friend suggested cinily.net, mentioning their positive reviews and good prices. I decided to take a chance, hoping for a smoother, more trustworthy experience.</p>
<p>And what a difference it made! My experience with cinily.net was exactly what I needed. As one satisfied customer beautifully put it, "Love my glasses. Will definitely use them again next time I purchase new ones. Service and shipping were fast and the price was so much better than getting them from my eye dr." I couldn't agree more!</p>
<p>From browsing their wide selection of <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">affordable prescription glasses</a> to the quick and efficient checkout process, everything was seamless. The quality of the Anti Blue Light Metal Square Myopia Glasses I received is fantastic â€“ they fit perfectly, feel durable, and genuinely reduce eye strain. Their customer service (though I barely needed it) was a stark contrast to my previous nightmare, proving that real human help still exists. I truly feel I got incredible value for my money. What a relief to finally have new glasses without all the stress! âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
